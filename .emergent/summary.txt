The previous AI engineer successfully implemented an enhanced authentication system from scratch, including proper email validation, new API endpoints (, ), and a smart frontend routing flow based on user existence. The work was then passed to me to restore comprehensive app sections that were streamlined during the authentication focus. I initiated the task by exploring the codebase to understand the current state of  and , confirming that many app sections were indeed missing or placeholder. The user explicitly requested to implement all missing sections with enhanced functionality, leading to a multi-phase plan. Phase 1, focusing on quick fixes like the trainer interface (with CRM), Google Maps integration in the trainers section, friends section functionality (add friend, leaderboard), and an enhanced analytics section, has been completed. Phase 2 commenced with fitness API integration (Fitbit/Google Fit) and session management overhaul. A playbook for fitness APIs was obtained and frontend/backend components were updated accordingly. The immediate next action is to test the backend changes for the new fitness integration.

The primary problem addressed is the need for a robust and user-friendly fitness application, LiftLink, which connects users with trainers, manages sessions, tracks progress, and facilitates social interaction. The previous phase successfully established a secure and intelligent authentication system, featuring real-time email validation, smart routing for existing vs. new users, and dedicated sign-in/onboarding flows.

The current phase focuses on restoring and enhancing the core application features that were temporarily removed or simplified during the authentication development. Key requirements include:
1.  **Comprehensive App Sections Restoration**: Re-implement all sections (Trainers, Rewards, Friends, Analytics, Settings, Sessions, etc.) with enhanced functionality.
2.  **Trainer Interface**: Develop a completely separate, CRM-focused interface for professional trainers, including a dashboard, client management, and a check-in system.
3.  **Google Maps Integration**: Add an interactive map to the Trainers section to show trainer locations.
4.  **Friends Section Enhancements**: Make the Add Friend button functional and implement a real-time leaderboard with competitive rankings.
5.  **Analytics Section**: Replace coming soon placeholders with detailed activity charts and progress tracking.
6.  **Fitness API Integration**: Integrate with Fitbit and Google Fit APIs for automatic workout tracking.
7.  **Check-in System**: Implement a trainer-confirmed session check-in system, removing manual session creation by users.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Pydantic (for form validation implicitly)
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (via MongoEngine), Uvicorn (managed by Supervisor)
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, running in a Kubernetes container environment.
-   **Deployment**: Supervisor for service management (frontend, backend), Kubernetes Ingress for API routing ( prefix).
-   **Key Integrations**: Google Maps API, Fitbit API, Google Fit API, custom Check-in system.
-   **Features**: Authentication, User Roles (Trainee/Trainer), CRM, Leaderboards, Analytics.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the core FastAPI application. It defines the API endpoints, handles database interactions (MongoDB), and implements business logic. It includes user authentication, registration, and now fitness integration endpoints.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Existing: ,  endpoints for authentication.
        -   Added: New API endpoints for fitness integration (e.g., , , ) as part of Phase 2. The exact function signatures were not fully shown but context indicates  functions with  decorators.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React application component. It manages global state (e.g., dark mode, user context), handles client-side routing, and conditionally renders different sections of the application based on user role and navigation.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initially streamlined for authentication only.
        -   Restored/implemented various sections: , , , , , .
        -   Introduced  component for trainers, conditionally rendered based on .
        -   Integrated Google Maps into .
        -   Updated  to include Add Friend functionality and a leaderboard.
        -   Replaced coming soon in .
        -   Added a Fitness tab to navigation and rendered the new fitness integration section.
        -   Removed manual session completion logic and calls from Dashboard, reflecting the new check-in system.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores frontend-specific environment variables, notably  for API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: None explicitly, but the AI engineer searched for API keys here.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores backend-specific environment variables, including  and .
    -   **Changes Made**: None explicitly, but the AI engineer searched for API keys here.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains the initial problem statement, testing data, and communication protocols. Crucial for understanding the project history and testing guidelines.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated by testing agents (not directly by the AI engineer in this trajectory).

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fitness API Integration (Fitbit/Google Fit)**: Frontend components and backend endpoints have been added based on the provided UNVERIFIED_PLAYBOOK, but full integration and functionality testing are pending.
-   **Check-in System**: The trainer-side check-in interface is implemented, but the full overhaul of session management (i.e., prohibiting manual session creation by trainees and enforcing trainer confirmation) needs completion and thorough testing.
-   **Google Maps API Key**: The required API key for Google Maps integration was not found in the environment variables and needs to be provided by the user for the map to function.
-   **Analytics Section**: While coming soon was removed, the depth of analytics might require further enhancements.
-   **Trainer CRM**: The inbuilt CRM was mentioned as implemented, but its comprehensive functionality and integration need verification.

<current_work>
Currently, the focus is on implementing Phase 2, which primarily involves Fitness API integration and overhauling the session management system.

The immediate work involved:
1.  **Fitness API Integration**:
    *   The previous AI engineer successfully obtained an UNVERIFIED_PLAYBOOK for Fitbit and Google Fit integration using .
    *   **Frontend**: Components for fitness integration have been added to . A new Fitness tab was added to the navigation, and the rendering logic () was updated to include this new section.
    *   **Backend**: New API endpoints in  have been implemented to support fitness data connection and synchronization, as dictated by the playbook. This includes routes like  and .

2.  **Session Management Overhaul**:
    *   Manual session creation capabilities have been removed from the trainee's dashboard in  by removing the  function and its associated UI elements.
    *   The intent is to replace manual sessions with trainer-confirmed check-ins and fitness device syncs. The trainer-side check-in interface was part of Phase 1 implementation.

The very next step is to test the newly added backend fitness integration endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly before proceeding with frontend testing or further feature development.
