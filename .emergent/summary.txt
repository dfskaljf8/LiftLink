The previous AI engineer diligently worked on the LiftLink application, primarily focusing on migrating the web MVP to a React Native mobile app and resolving critical infrastructure issues. A significant portion of the trajectory involved a persistent battle with GitHub's secret push protection, requiring multiple attempts at WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history

Simultaneously, the engineer addressed user requests to migrate MongoDB from local to Atlas, which surfaced challenging SSL compatibility issues, leading to a temporary fallback to local database. The most recent efforts centered on debugging and fixing Render deployment failures, which inadvertently reintroduced secret detection issues in newly created configuration files, prompting another round of secret cleanup and history rewriting.

The LiftLink application aims to connect fitness enthusiasts with trainers, offering session management, progress tracking, and social functionalities. The ongoing development involves enhancing existing sections like Trainers, Rewards, Friends, Analytics, Settings, and Sessions, and developing a comprehensive trainer CRM. Key integrations include Google Maps, Google Fit (replacing Fitbit), and Google Calendar. Core features entail Add Friend, leaderboards, and detailed analytics. Essential system improvements include removing email verification for alternative methods, implementing age and certification verification, and enabling user name editing. A robust Stripe-only payment system is critical for user payments and trainer payouts. The entire web application is being converted to a React Native mobile framework for iOS and Android, complete with app icon implementation. Architecturally, all backend API routes must be prefixed with , and frontend email validation is required. A crucial, recurring task has been ensuring secure GitHub pushes by eliminating all hardcoded secrets from current files and git history. Most recently, the work included updating MongoDB connection to MongoDB Atlas and resolving Render deployment issues.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture comprises a React Native mobile frontend () and a FastAPI backend (), with a deprecated React web app ().


-   ****: The core FastAPI application. It has been modified to handle Stripe Connect, manage user data, and integrate with MongoDB. Recent changes include adjusting the MongoDB connection for Atlas (with fallback to local) and dynamically setting the server port for Render deployments. A  endpoint was added for debugging.
-   ****: Stores backend environment variables like . Initially contained secrets that caused GitHub issues; it is now properly gitignored, with  configured for MongoDB Atlas (with local fallback).
-   ****: Handles Stripe payment UI in the React Native app. Modified to fetch Stripe keys from environment variables rather than hardcoding.
-   ****: Crucial for preventing sensitive files (like  files and temporary documentation containing secrets) from being committed to the repository. It has been extensively updated to ensure sensitive files are ignored.
-   ****: (New file) Specifies how Render should start the Python backend application (). Essential for Render to correctly identify and run the Python service.
-   ****: (New file) Declares the Python version for the Render environment ().
-   ****: (New file) A shell script for Render's build process, moving  to the root and installing dependencies.
-   ****: (New file) Created as an empty file to enable the  directory to be recognized as a Python package, allowing  to import .
-   ****: Moved to the root directory for Render compatibility, and its contents were cleaned and updated to include necessary packages like .
-   ** & **: (New files, removed from history) Created to guide Render deployment environment variable setup. Initially contained API key patterns that triggered GitHub protection, and were subsequently cleaned and removed from git history.
-   ****: (New file, gitignored) Created to securely store actual Render-specific environment variables locally, ensuring they are not committed to Git.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full integration of Google Fit and Google Calendar APIs, as real OAuth configuration in Google Cloud Console is pending user action to resolve 403 errors (though API keys were provided).
-   Successfully resolving the persistent MongoDB Atlas SSL compatibility issue for production deployment, as the current setup relies on local MongoDB as a fallback.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep in resolving the recurring GitHub push protection issue. The user's last GitHub push failed because secrets were detected in newly created deployment configuration files:  and . These files, intended to aid Render deployment, inadvertently contained Google OAuth Client Secret and Client ID patterns.

The engineer's actions to address this included:
1.  **Cleaning **: Replaced actual API keys with generic placeholders (Chat Message 377).
2.  **Cleaning **: Replaced actual API keys with generic placeholders (Chat Message 379).
3.  **Creating **: A new file created to store actual API keys locally, explicitly designed to be gitignored to prevent future accidental commits (Chat Message 381).
4.  **Updating **: Added  to the  to ensure it is not tracked by Git (Chat Message 383).
5.  **Verifying cleanliness**: Confirmed that the deployment files no longer contained secrets (Chat Message 385).
6.  **Rewriting Git History**: Executed another WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history

Proceeding with filter-branch... operation just completed successfully, and the engineer's last action (Chat Message 388) was to check the current git status to confirm the repository's cleanliness. The overall goal is to enable a successful GitHub push and then proceed with verifying the Render deployment.

<optional_next_step>
Check the current git status and then re-attempt the GitHub push to confirm the persistent secret push protection issue is finally resolved.
