<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the LiftLink application from an MVP web app to a comprehensive React Native mobile application, addressing critical user feedback iteratively. Initial efforts focused on refining core features like payment (migrating to Stripe-only after Google Wallet issues), user profile management, and integrating APIs (Google Fit/Calendar, albeit with initial 403 errors requiring mock setups). A significant pivot involved scaffolding and progressively converting the web application's functionality and UI components into a pure React Native structure. Key challenges included resolving React Native specific build errors in the web environment, fixing backend API endpoints to support new data fields, refining dashboard layouts, and meticulously converting web CSS styles to native React Native  objects. The process also involved setting up app icons for both iOS and Android and creating a dedicated Apple App Store review pathway. The current state reflects a nearly complete mobile app, with the immediate task being the final cleanup and removal of legacy web-specific files from the  directory, ensuring a truly native mobile codebase.

The LiftLink application aims to connect fitness enthusiasts with professional trainers, managing sessions, tracking progress, and enabling social interaction. The initial phase established secure authentication with real-time email validation and smart routing. The ongoing objectives include restoring and enhancing comprehensive app sections (Trainers, Rewards, Friends, Analytics, Settings, Sessions), developing a trainer CRM, integrating Google Maps, implementing an Add Friend and leaderboard system, replacing coming soon in Analytics with detailed tracking, integrating Google Fit for workout tracking (replacing Fitbit), implementing a trainer-confirmed check-in system, removing email verification, implementing age/certification verification, allowing user name editing, integrating a robust Stripe-only payment system (Google Wallet removed), and crucially, converting the entire web application to a React Native mobile framework for iOS and Android, including a provided app icon.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full integration of Google Fit and Google Calendar APIs, as real OAuth configuration in Google Cloud Console is pending user action to resolve 403 errors.
-   Complete removal of remaining web-specific files (, , etc.) from the  directory to fully commit to a pure React Native mobile application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on the final stages of converting the LiftLink application into a pure React Native mobile app. The user explicitly requested the removal of web-specific files, namely , , and  from the  directory, emphasizing that the application should be a mobile app, not a website.

The AI engineer acknowledged this request and had begun the process of removing these unnecessary web-related files. The last action observed was identifying the presence of these files and confirming the plan to remove them to ensure a clean, native React Native codebase. This task follows previous efforts to convert web CSS styles to React Native  objects and implement a dedicated Apple App Store review login and guide. The removal of these files is crucial for a complete and clean React Native conversion.
