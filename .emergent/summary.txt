The previous AI engineer successfully transformed LiftLink from a web MVP to a React Native mobile app, addressing numerous feature enhancements and critical fixes. Initial work focused on migrating core functionalities like payments to Stripe, refining user profiles, and integrating APIs (Google Fit/Calendar). A significant phase involved meticulous conversion of web UI to native React Native components, including style adaptations and app icon setup. Key challenges included resolving React Native build issues in a hybrid environment, fixing backend API inconsistencies, and, crucially, addressing persistent GitHub push protection failures due to hardcoded secrets. The engineer systematically removed web-specific files, implemented robust Stripe Connect for real trainer payouts, and enhanced email format validation.

The LiftLink application connects fitness enthusiasts with trainers, facilitating session management, progress tracking, and social features. The initial phase focused on secure authentication and smart routing. Current objectives include:
- Restore and enhance app sections: Trainers, Rewards, Friends, Analytics, Settings, Sessions.
- Develop a trainer CRM.
- Integrate Google Maps.
- Implement Add Friend and leaderboards.
- Replace coming soon in Analytics with detailed tracking.
- Integrate Google Fit for workout tracking (replacing Fitbit).
- Implement a trainer-confirmed check-in system.
- Remove email verification in favor of other verification services.
- Implement age and certification verification.
- Allow user name editing.
- Integrate a robust Stripe-only payment system, enabling users to pay trainers and trainers to cash out earnings. Google Wallet was removed.
- Convert the entire web application to a React Native mobile framework for iOS and Android, including app icon implementation.
- Ensure all backend API routes are prefixed with .
- Validate email formats on the frontend to be legitimate.
- Enable secure push to GitHub by removing all hardcoded secrets and ensuring they are not present in git history.

<code_architecture>
The application has shifted from a React web app () to a primary React Native mobile app (), supported by a FastAPI backend ().



-   ****: Core FastAPI backend. Handles API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated real Stripe Connect endpoints (, , , ). Removed email verification related imports/endpoints (which were already mostly gone). Ensures  field is handled in user updates.
-   ****: Handles Stripe payment logic.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use Stripe Connect for creating Express accounts, generating onboarding links, and processing real destination charges and transfers. App domain placeholders were replaced with the actual backend URL.
-   ****: Removed entirely as per user request to drop email verification.
-   ****: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: ,  removed.  added. Removed from git tracking.
-   ****: Main React Native component.
    -   **Changes**: Frontend email validation improved with real-time feedback and regex. Hardcoded Stripe key removed and replaced with environment variable.
-   ****: React Native payment UI.
    -   **Changes**: Hardcoded Stripe key removed and replaced with environment variable.
-   ****: Android app manifest.
    -   **Changes**: Hardcoded Stripe key replaced with placeholder, to be populated via environment.
-   ****: React Native project dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes**: Dependencies for React Native Web (e.g., , , ) were added, then *removed* after user clarification to focus on pure mobile.  added to .
-   ****: Git exclusion file.
    -   **Changes**: , , , ,  and related patterns were added to prevent secret exposure.
-   ** & **: New files for environment variable templates.
    -   **Summary**: Provide safe templates for required environment variables without exposing actual secrets in version control.
-   **, , , **: These files were created to document/store API keys but inadvertently committed with real secrets, leading to repeated GitHub push failures. The AI engineer attempted to clean these and their history multiple times using WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history

<pending_tasks>
- Full integration of Google Fit and Google Calendar APIs, as real OAuth configuration in Google Cloud Console is pending user action to resolve 403 errors. (Resolved by providing API keys and explaining mobile vs web differences).
- Complete removal of remaining web-specific files from the  directory (mostly done, but directory structure indicates some files might still exist but are empty).
- Successfully push the code to GitHub without secret push protection blocking the operation. This involves ensuring no secrets are in any current files or git history.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was deep in the process of resolving persistent GitHub push failures. The user had reported that pushing to GitHub was blocked due to secret protection. The engineer identified hardcoded secrets in ,  (React Native), , and various documentation/temporary files (, , , ).

The engineer took the following actions:
1.  Replaced hardcoded Stripe keys in React Native components (, ) and  with environment variable references or placeholders.
2.  Created  files for  and  to provide secure templates.
3.  Updated  to prevent  files and the newly created documentation/private key files from being tracked by Git.
4.  Attempted to clean secrets from documentation files (, , ).
5.  Repeatedly used WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch... to rewrite the git history and remove problematic files (like , , ) that contained secrets and had been accidentally committed. This was a multi-attempt process as new files were sometimes created with secrets, leading to re-introduction of the issue.
6.  Removed the actual  files from git tracking.

Despite extensive efforts and multiple WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch... commands, the user's last message (Chat Message 503) indicates that the GitHub push is *still failing* due to secrets detected in commits, specifically in , , and . The engineer's last action (Chat Message 505) was another WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an

	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch... to remove  from history, with the intention of confirming no secrets remain. This suggests the primary focus is entirely on purging secrets to enable GitHub push.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Thoroughly verify that all secrets, including those in git history, have been completely purged, and then re-attempt the GitHub push.
