# GitHub Push Protection Test

This file is created to test if GitHub push protection is still blocking the repository after cleaning up all secret patterns.

## Changes Made:
1. ✅ Removed PRIVATE_KEYS.md file with actual secrets
2. ✅ Replaced AIzaSy_REDACTED patterns with generic placeholders
3. ✅ Replaced sk_test_ patterns with generic placeholders  
4. ✅ Replaced pk_test_ and pk_live_ patterns with generic placeholders
5. ✅ Replaced checkout session IDs and payment intent IDs with generic placeholders

## Status:
- All current files cleaned of secret-like patterns
- Git history should now allow push to GitHub
